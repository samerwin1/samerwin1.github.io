## Description

This page shows the power budget for the major components involved in the circuitry of the Distance Sensing Subsystem. The power budget was created to theorize maximum possible current draw from each major electrical component, as well as describe how the power for the system will be supplied. This ensures that the power source/voltage regulator are capable of providing all necessary current to the subsystem without being overloaded.

## Conclusions

From the Power Budget, it is clear that the 9V wall supply and 5V linear regulator will be sufficient to safely power the subsytem with extra headroom for minor components (resistors, capacitors, etc).
