**Choice:** Option 1: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

**Rationale:** The ulrasonic sensor has the best range which is important for detecting people approaching the door, as well as obstacles in its path, as soon as possible. Additionally, the output of the sensor being directly linear to object distance is ideal for simplifying software implementation. The range of operating voltage between 3.3V and 5V ensures that the sensor will continue to work properly even in the case of moderate voltage fluctuation. It is also important that it cannot be affected by environmental lighting conditions or reflectivity of objects. Finally, it is one of the more affordable options which is important since we will need more than one for our design.
