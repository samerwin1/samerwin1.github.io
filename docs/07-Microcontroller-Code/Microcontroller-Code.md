## Description

This page provides the code written and used to program the PIC18F57Q43-CNANO microcontroller for the distance-sensing subsystem.

## Inividual Verification Code

[*This*](EmitterDetector.zip) is the code used to verify functionality of the distance-sensing subsystem while on its own (not connected to the other subsystems). It uses a button to simulate input from the rotary system during calibration, door opening, and door closing.


## Final Program Code

[*This*](DistanceSensingSubsystem.zip) is the final version of the code used in the product (connected to and communicating with the other subsystems).
