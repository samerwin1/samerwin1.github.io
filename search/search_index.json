While automatic doors are nothing new, the vision is to bring the idea into private homes/properties while also making the technology inexpensive and easy to integrate. More specifically our target consumers are those with disabilities and their caregivers, however we want the product to appeal to anyone desiring efficiency and automation in their home.</p> <p>The product will be installable on any lighter-weight swinging interior door. After a simple install, a single button press will open and promptly close the door while multiple sensors collect data along the path. From then on, the door will automatically open any time someone approaches from either side, wait a period of time, and then automatically close. The multiple sensors will be able to detect any obstacles in the way or variations from the typical path and stop the door from becoming hazardous.</p> <p>The function of the product is acheived through the combination of four embedded subsystems:</p> <ul> <li>Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem (focus of this datasheet)</li> <li>Motor Subsystem</li> <li>Rotary Encoder Subsystem</li> <li>Resistive Flex Sensor Subsystem</li> </ul> <p>These four subsystems each play a vital role and communicate with each other in order to control the final product. Each subsystem was designed by an individual member of the team. To learn more about the other subsystems, how they all work together, and the design process of the whole project, you can visit the Team Report Website.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My personal contribution to the Private-Use Door Automation project is the Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem. It uses two IR emitter/detector pairs which are signal conditioned, amplified, and processed through a microcontroller to provide accurate distance measurements. One pair is placed on either side of the door in order to provide a view of its direct path.</p> <p>During calibration the door opens 90 degrees and then closes. While this happens, the sensors store distance values of the nearest object in their view at several points along the path. In \"standby mode\", the sensors tell the motor to open the door once they detect a person approaching. As the door opens, they periodically check their current values with those stored during calibration. Any inequality in these values sends an alert through the system which stops the motor until the obstruction is clear.</p> <p>This website was created to provide an understanding of how the subsystem was designed and brought to reality.</p> <ul> <li>To learn about the hardware components and their connections to the microcontroller, visit the \"Block Diagram\" page.</li> <li>To understand why specific components were chosen, visit the \"Component Selection\" page.</li> <li>To see the list of materials for the subsystem, visit the \"BOM\" page.</li> <li>To visualize the electrical flow of the circuitry, visit the \"Schematic\" page.</li> <li>To see a breakdown of each component's current draw and how power is provided to the system, visit the \"Power Budget\" page.</li> <li>Finally, to see additional supporting information not included in the main pages, visit the \"Apendix\" page.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This page shows a consructed block diagram representing the hardware components of my personal subsystem which will be embedded into the greater project system. This subsystem focuses on sensing distances to objects from the door which the device will be installed on. There will be one sensor circuit on either side of the door. Each time the device is triggered to open the door, the sensor circuits will be verifying that nothing is in the path of the door as it is opening.</p> <p>Every component in this subsystem will be powered by a 5 volt, 1.5 Amp voltage regulating circuit which itself will be supplied by a 12 volt power source. This is shown by the dashed-line box surrounding the components. The logic and communication functions will be handled by the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity-Nano, symbolized by the large block in the center of the diagram. Each other block inside the 5 volt supplied box symbolizes a component which will be connected to the PIC18F57Q43. The directional arrows show whether the components are inputs or outputs and are labeled with their signal type, voltage level, and number of pins. The blocks inside the PIC18F57Q43 block show which pin the components are connected to and what peripheral of the device they will be using.</p> <p>Finally, the block at the bottom of the diagram labeled \"connector 3\" symbolizes a header for the 8-wire ribbon cable which will be used to connect this subsytem to another subsystem (the motor system) within the project. As shown, my subsystem will be receiving 3 signal inputs (2 digital and 1 analog) and sending 2 outputs (both digital). This will allow the two subsystems to communicate with one another based on the programming of the PIC18F57Q43 devices. The goal is to have this distance-sensing subsytem tell the motor subsystem to start, continue running, or stop based on the data it is processing.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#distance-sensing-subsystem-block-diagram","title":"Distance-Sensing Subsystem Block Diagram","text":"DRAWIO File Link","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Description</p> <p>This page shows the process of choosing the hardware for the distance-sensing subsystem of the Private-Use Door Automation project. The tables below show the options that were proposed, each with a list of pros and cons related to the constraints and desired results of the design.</p> <p>Emitter</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. OPB732 Long Distance Reflective Switch$4.61/eachlink to product *Emmiter &amp; Detector in one package* Affordable* Already familiar with* Housing to reduce ambient light sensitivity * Low range* Low forward current* Lower wavelength* Most expensive Option 2.TSAL6200 IR Emitting Diode  $0.49/each  Link to product * Least expensive * High radiant power/intensity* Higher peak wavelength* High forward current * No focused casing/lense* Lower peak forward current(although with higher duty cycle)* Does not include detector Option 2.1N6265 IR LED Emitter $0.95/each  Link to product * Inexpensive* More focused casing* High forward current* High power dissipation * Highest forward voltage* Low radiant power* Radiant intensity not listed* Does not include detector <p>Choice: Option 2: TSAL6200 IR Emitting Diode</p> <p>Rationale: While it is tempting to use the OPB732 since it is a paired package, our system needs a higher radiant intensity in order to detect objects further away. Additionally, the higher peak wavelength is ideal in order to distinguish the sensor from ambient visible light sources. While the peak forward currents ratings of the other two options are slightly higher, it is ideal that the TSAL6200 is rated for a higher pulse duty cycle at its peak which improves the refresh rate of the system. Lastly, it is very inexpensive.</p> <p>Detector</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. OPB732 Long Distance Reflective Switch$4.61/eachlink to product *Emmiter &amp; Detector in one package* Affordable* Already familiar with* Housing to reduce ambient light sensitivity * Low power dissipation* Higher dark current* Lower breakdown voltage* Most expensive Option 2.QSB34ZR Silicon Pin Photodiode  $1.14/each  Link to product * Affordable * High radiant sensitivity* Daylight-blocking filter* Good power dissipation * Very wide reception angle* Surface mount package(harder to keep in place when not directly on PCB)* Does not include emitter Option 2.BPV23NF Silicon PIN Photodiode $1.08/each  Link to product * Affordable* Daylight-blocking filter* High radiant sensitivity* High power dissipation* Low dark current * Side-mounted(could be hard to place at correct angle for emitter)* Wide range of detectable wavelength* Does not include emitter <p>Choice: Option 3: BPV23NF Silicon PIN Photodiode</p> <p>Rationale: As stated for the emitter selection, a two-in-one package would be convinient, but it is more important that the detector is low-noise yet sensitive enough for precise, longer-range use. Between the QSB34ZR and the BPV23NF, they have very similar features/specifications. The main distinction between them is the reception angle (much higher on the QSB34ZR) which is not ideal for focused reflective sensing. Additionally, the surface-mount packaging would make it more difficult to intsall in a wired configuration. In order to reduce the amount of environmental noise and uphold practical installation, the BPV23NF was chosen.</p> <p>Operational Amplifier</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. LMC6482 $5.62/eachlink to product *Affordable* Low input bias current* Rail to rail* Low quiescent current * Lower speed* Lowest slew rate* Headroom loss near rails* Sensitive to heavy loads Option 2. MCP6022  $1.86/each  Link to product * Least expensive option * High GBW* High slew rate* Rail to rail with minimal loss* Low noise* Low quiescent current * Limited load drive* Lowest operating supply range Option 2. OPA2704  $6.36/each  Link to product * Balance of performance and power* Rail to rail* Lowest input offset* Acceptable quiescent current * Most expensive option* Lower speed* Lower slew rate* No through-hole packages in stock <p>Choice: Option 2: MCP6022</p> <p>Rationale: The MCP6022 seems most capable for handling quick-changing analog signals, has low noise, and should have minimal voltage loss when near the rails of the supply. All of these features make it ideal for amplifying the signal of the photodiode without corrupting important data.</p> <p>MOSFET</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. 2N7000 $0.21/eachlink to product *Least expensive* Current rating meets goal* Easy to source * Lower current rating than other options* Higher Rds(on)* Lower power dissipation Option 2. IRLZ44NPBF  $1.53/each  Link to product * Affordable * Very high current rating* High power dissipation * More expensive than other options* High Input Capacitance Option 2. FQP13N06L  $0.68/each  Link to product * Inexpensive* Most balanced performance vs cost* Mid-grade current rating * Only sold in bulk* High shipping fee* Higher input capacitance <p>Choice: Option 2: IRLZ44NPBF</p> <p>Rationale: Since the MOSFET will be used for running high current through the IR Emitters, the high current rating and power dissipation make it ideal. Although it has a higher input capacitance, the lower frequency of the pulse signal does not cause concern in this area. While it is the most expensive option, it is still affordable and nowhere near budget-breaking.</p> <p>Voltage Regulator</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. LM7805 Linear Voltage Regulator$0.33/eachlink to product *Affordable* Fits project goals* Already provided * Higher voltage dropout* Lower max current* Not optimized for efficiency Option 2. LM1085IT-5.0 Linear Voltage Regulator  $2.13/each  Link to product * Higher current capability * Low voltage dropout* Better regulation characteristics * Expensive* Poor efficiency Option 2. LM2941T Linear Voltage Regulator  $1.72/each  Link to product * Lowest voltage dropout* Low noise* Ranging output voltage * Expensive* Lowest current rating <p>Choice: Option 1: LM7805 Linear Voltage Regulator</p> <p>Rationale: The LM7805 meets the subsystem's needs for supply current, input voltage, and output voltage. On top of meeting the requirements, it has already been provided and therefore there is no reason to order and implement a different option.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This page shows a spreadsheet of all physical components used in the design of the Distance-Sensing Subsystem.

This light hits the objects on either side of the door and reflects back into the photodiodes with an intensity that is proportional to distance. The Emitter 1 and Emitter 2 tags show the 20kHz pulsed input from the microcontroller going into their respective MOSFET gates. Each time a pulse is received the MOSFET opens the flow from 5V to GND, sending a high current through the IR Emitter, then closes it again. This setup allows the IR Emitters to flash brightly at 20kHZ, allowing it to be distinguished from background IR in the environment. The high current allows the emitters to still output a strong enough radiance for the photodiodes to pick up on.</p>"},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#ir-photodiodes","title":"IR Photodiodes","text":"<p>This module contains the IR photodiodes and supporting circuitry. At the left side are two voltage dividers which provide reference voltages (~0.1V and 2.5V) for the operational amplifiers. Immediately to the right of these are the supply nodes of the operational amplifier (5V for VDD and GND for VSS). To the right of the supply nodes is the dual-stage amplification of the photodiode. The first stage is a transimpedance amplifier which converts the tiny current of the photodiode into a measurable voltage from ~0.1-4.9V. The 22pF capacitor is in parallel with the feedback resistor to filter out the high frequency AC noise while still picking up on the 20kHz signal of the emitters. The second stage is an inverting amplifier with a gain of 1. This flips the extremes of the voltage so that 0.1V becomes 4.9V and vice versa. This means that a small current from the photodiode (an object being far away and therefore reflecting low amounts of light) translates to a large voltage. A larger current from the photodiode (an object being near) translates into a small voltage. The analog output is then sent to the microcontoller which translates the voltages into distance values.</p> <p>The right side of this module is the second photodiode circuit, and works exactly the same way.</p>"},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#ribbon-cable-connector","title":"Ribbon Cable Connector","text":"<p>The final module shows the connections coming in from/going out to the other subsystems.
