This subsystem focuses on sensing distances to objects from the door which the device will be installed on. There will be one sensor on either side of the door. Each time the device is triggered to open the door, the sensors will be verifying that nothing is in the path of the door as it is opening.</p> <p>Every component in this subsystem will be powered by a 5 volt, 1.5 Amp voltage regulating circuit which itself will be supplied by a 9 volt power source. This is shown by the dashed-line box surrounding the components. The logic and communication functions will be handled by the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity-Nano, symbolized by the large block in the center of the diagram. Each other block inside the 5 volt supplied box symbolizes a component which will be connected to the PIC18F57Q43. The directional arrows show whether the components are inputs or outputs and are labeled with their signal type, voltage level, and number of pins. The blocks inside the PIC18F57Q43 block show which pin the components are connected to and what peripheral of the device they will be using.</p> <p>Finally, the block at the bottom of the diagram labeled \"connector 3\" symbolizes a header for the 8-wire ribbon cable which will be used to connect this subsytem to another subsystem (the motor system) within the project. As shown, my subsystem will be receiving 3 signal inputs (2 digital and 1 analog) and sending 2 outputs (both digital). This will allow the two subsystems to communicate with one another based on the programming of the PIC18F57Q43 devices. The goal is to have this distance-sensing subsytem tell the motor subsystem to start, continue running, or stop based on the data it is processing.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#distance-sensing-subsystem-block-diagram","title":"Distance-Sensing Subsystem Block Diagram","text":"DRAWIO File Link","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Description</p> <p>This page shows the process of choosing the hardware for the distance-sensing subsystem of the Private-Use Door Automation project. The tables below show the options that were proposed, each with a list of pros and cons related to the constraints and desired results of the design.</p> <p>Distance Sensors</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. URM09 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor$7.90/eachlink to product *Conditionable analog output* Affordable* Great Range(2cm to ~500cm)* Adequate Accuracy(within 1%)* Not affected by external light* Linear Response* Low operating voltage * Succeptable to sound in environment* Slower response due to speed of sound* Small angular-mount freedom Option 2.GP2Y0A21YK0F IR Distance Sensor  $14.95/each  Link to product * Conditionable analog output * Better for angular-mounting* Faster than ultrasonic * Most expensive* Low Range (10cm-80cm)* Non-Linear Response* Succeptable to environmental light* Succeptable to reflective surfaces* Accuracy not stated in datasheet Option 2.VL53L3CXV0DH/1 FlightSense Optical Sensor $4.95/each  Link to product * Least expensive option* Good range(300m) with high close-up accuracy* Linear Response* Class 1 Laser for safety* Low operating voltage* Fastest Response* Best for anglular-mounting* 25 degree FOV operation for multiple readings at once * Internal microchip(daughterboard); invalid for project scope* High pin-count* Complicated wiring/integration* Non-conditionable output* Low maximum voltage <p>Choice: Option 1: URM09 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</p> <p>Rationale: The ulrasonic sensor has the best range which is important for detecting people approaching the door, as well as obstacles in its path, as soon as possible. Additionally, the output of the sensor being directly linear to object distance is ideal for simplifying software implementation. The range of operating voltage between 3.3V and 5.5V ensures that the sensor will continue to work properly even in the case of moderate voltage fluctuation. It is also important that it cannot be affected by environmental lighting conditions or reflectivity of objects. Finally, it is one of the more affordable options which is important since we will need more than one for our design.</p> <p>Operational Amplifier</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1. LMC6482 $5.62/eachlink to product *Affordable* Low input bias current* Rail to rail* Low quiescent current * Lower speed* Lowest slew rate* Headroom loss near rails* Sensitive to heavy loads Option 2. MCP6022  $1.86/each  Link to product * Least expensive option * High GBW* High slew rate* Rail to rail with minimal loss* Low noise* Low quiescent current * Limited load drive* Lowest operating supply range Option 2. OPA2704  $6.36/each  Link to product * Balance of performance and power* Rail to rail* Lowest input offset* Acceptable quiescent current * Most expensive option* Lower speed* Lower slew rate* No through-hole packages in stock <p>Choice: Option 2: MCP6022</p> <p>Rationale: The MCP6022 seems most capable for handling quick-changing analog signals, has low noise, and should have minimal voltage loss when near the rails of the supply. All of these features make it ideal for amplifying the signal of the ultrasonic distance sensor without corrupting important data.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
