While automatic doors are nothing new, the vision is to bring the idea into private homes/properties while also making the technology inexpensive and easy to integrate. More specifically our target consumers are those with disabilities and their caregivers, however we want the product to appeal to anyone desiring efficiency and automation in their home.</p> <p>The product will be installable on any lighter-weight swinging interior door. After a simple install, a single button press will open and promptly close the door while multiple sensors collect data along the path. From then on, the door will automatically open any time someone approaches from either side, wait a period of time, and then automatically close. The multiple sensors will be able to detect any obstacles in the way or variations from the typical path and stop the door from becoming hazardous.</p> <p>The function of the product is acheived through the combination of four embedded subsystems:</p> <ul> <li>Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem (focus of this datasheet)</li> <li>Motor Subsystem</li> <li>Rotary Encoder Subsystem</li> <li>Resistive Flex Sensor Subsystem</li> </ul> <p>These four subsystems each play a vital role and communicate with each other in order to control the final product. Each subsystem was designed by an individual member of the team. To learn more about the other subsystems, how they all work together, and the design process of the whole project, you can visit the Team Report Website.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My personal contribution to the Private-Use Door Automation project is the Infrared Distance-Sensing Subsystem. It uses two IR emitter/detector pairs which are signal conditioned, amplified, and processed through a microcontroller to provide accurate distance measurements. One pair is placed on either side of the door in order to provide a view of its direct path.</p> <p>During calibration the door opens 90 degrees and then closes. While this happens, the sensors store distance values of the nearest object in their view at several points along the path. In \"standby mode\", the sensors tell the motor to open the door once they detect a person approaching. As the door opens, they periodically check their current values with those stored during calibration. Any inequality in these values sends an alert through the system which stops the motor until the obstruction is clear.</p> <p>This website was created to provide an understanding of how the subsystem was designed and brought to reality.</p> <ul> <li>To learn about the hardware components and their connections to the microcontroller, visit the \"Block Diagram\" page.</li> <li>To understand why specific components were chosen, visit the \"Component Selection\" page.</li> <li>To see the list of materials for the subsystem, visit the \"BOM\" page.</li> <li>To visualize the electrical flow of the circuitry, visit the \"Schematic\" page.</li> <li>To see a breakdown of each component's current draw and how power is provided to the system, visit the \"Power Budget\" page.</li> <li>Finally, to see additional supporting information not included in the main pages, visit the \"Apendix\" page.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This page shows a consructed block diagram representing the components of my personal subsystem which will be embedded into the greater project system. This subsystem focuses on sensing distances to objects from the door which the device will be installed on. There will be one sensor on either side of the door. Each time the device is triggered to open the door, the sensors will be verifying that nothing is in the path of the door as it is opening.</p> <p>Every component in this subsystem will be powered by a 5 volt, 1.5 Amp voltage regulating circuit which itself will be supplied by a 9 volt power source. This is shown by the dashed-line box surrounding the components. The logic and communication functions will be handled by the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity-Nano, symbolized by the large block in the center of the diagram. Each other block inside the 5 volt supplied box symbolizes a component which will be connected to the PIC18F57Q43. The directional arrows show whether the components are inputs or outputs and are labeled with their signal type, voltage level, and number of pins. The blocks inside the PIC18F57Q43 block show which pin the components are connected to and what peripheral of the device they will be using.</p> <p>Finally, the block at the bottom of the diagram labeled \"connector 3\" symbolizes a header for the 8-wire ribbon cable which will be used to connect this subsytem to another subsystem (the motor system) within the project. As shown, my subsystem will be receiving 3 signal inputs (2 digital and 1 analog) and sending 2 outputs (both digital). This will allow the two subsystems to communicate with one another based on the programming of the PIC18F57Q43 devices. The goal is to have this distance-sensing subsytem tell the motor subsystem to start, continue running, or stop based on the data it is processing.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#distance-sensing-subsystem-block-diagram","title":"Distance-Sensing Subsystem Block Diagram","text":"DRAWIO File Link","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Description</p> <p>This page shows the process of choosing the hardware for the distance-sensing subsystem of the Private-Use Door Automation project.

Additionally, the higher peak wavelength is ideal in order to distinguish the sensor from ambient visible light sources. While the peak forward currents ratings of the other two options are slightly higher, it is ideal that the TSAL6200 is rated for a higher pulse duty cycle at its peak which improves the refresh rate of the system.
